# ES 6 - 12 ...

Basically, some notes I took on new features on each of the new ES versions since ES6 which at the time of writting the latest version is ES12.

## Running code snips

### ES 6 -10

For debugging the samples I use `code runner` which its a vs code plugin to run some code lines without need of node can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

### ES 11

For this version you need to add the plugin [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
